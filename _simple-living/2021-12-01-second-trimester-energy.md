### Background

Just wanted to note this amazing personal journey down in case third trimester slaps me with reality . If that happens, I can read this post again and regain momentum hopefully. I've been feeling super productive and curious so far. I'm very thankful for the healthy baby inside me, which allows me to be open-minded and learn more about myself along the way.

### What exactly is happening?

I keep this quote from Steve Jobs close to my heart `You can only connect the dots looking backward`. I use that spirit as an excuse to do the most random things ever because I tell myself one day, my action will make sense. Random things are like writing cold emails to companies/individuals and see if they need product/ops help. Of course, these companies/individuals are working on products/projects that fall under my interest areas. At the beginning of year, I set out my interest ares that I want to explore. They are sustainability and mindfulness. And off I went, I searched for these companies/individuals' emails and probably sent about 30+ of them. I'm grateful that some of them were very kind to reply my request. Some rejected in the end but that's just part of the process.

Below were some companies / individuals that replied me:
* [Rejected] Anya Active: A local sports apparel that I have been a customer for the past 2 years. I like their material, price point and customer service. Unfortunately, they needed full-time help, so maybe another time.
* [Rejected] Oasis: A local brand focusing on no-packing products (they made their own soaps). I bought few items from them before and was happy with the purchase. However, when I told them I could only do online, they didn't reply me.
* [Ended] Bambino: A local brand that provides baby clothing subscription. I had few chats with the founder but it seems to me that this is more like a lifestyle business, so I wasn't asked to contribute much. This gig is more like one-off activity for me. Luckily, it didn't take much of my time.
* [Ongoing] Safe Space: A local company that provides online counselling services. I'm also their customer and fortunately, they need product help. I've been enjoying helping them so far. It started since July 2021. The work didn't take much of my time and it helps with my product and industry learning to certain extent.
* [Ongoing] Back To Ground Zero: A local project that aims to spread sustainability lifestyle. I reached out them end November and I'm helping them with the curriculum development. Another area for me to explore
* [Not started] Calm Collective Asia: A local project that aims to spread awareness about mental health. I had few email exchanges with the founder. I almost applied to be a volunteer for their CCA conference in November but I thought to myself I couldn't stretch myself too thin so I didn't apply in the end. However, I will have a chat with the founder in the upcoming week. Let's see where it takes me.
* [Not started] Sarah Blondin: She's my favourite meditation teacher in Insight Timer. I guess I rave about her every time people aske me what meditation app I use. We had few email exchanges but nothing becomes concrete yet. So let's wait and see.

So whatever is ongoing I mentioned above is on top of my full-time job. Yet I still have time to do self-care ([I'm pretty consistent with my exercise routine](/simple-living/second-trimester-exercise-routine)) and take care of my family (I mean meal prep). So far so good.

### Yet I'm still anxious

No matter how joyful this journey is, I somehow find myself thinking of something to worry about. As much as I love what is happening now, I'm scared that I have to let them go (due to health, time management, priority reasons) when the baby comes. I'm just prematurely sad that this joyful period might have to come an end. Or can I do anything about it? I tried to create a time table for myself after maternity leave but there are still a lot of unknown variables. So I have to wait for them to happen, I guess.
