### Background

The person in the thumbnail is not me. She's Chloe Ting, a fitness influencer in Youtube from Australia. As I want to prepare my body for what's coming up next, I thought to myself: `What should I prepare?`

### Prior to pregnancy

I'm never a fan of intense training. I just simply don't like it. There were quite a lot of strength exercises that I couldn't do (e.g. push-ups), which demotivates me. However, I know it's important to incorporate some cardio work. The normal me usually picked a 28-day challenge from [Chloe Ting](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChloesAddiction) and followed along or as much as I could. That was for the morning. Then it's followed by a 20 mins of meditation. Yummy!!

Then, in the afternoon, I did stretching from my favourite guide [Yoga With Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/c/yogawithadriene).

Once a week, I would go to a studio in [Yoga Movement](https://yogamovement.com/). I was craving for some community vibe which YM perfectly embodies it, at least for me.

### First trimester

The first trimester is the hardest I didn't have much energy. I was lucky that I didn't have bad morning sickness but low energy didn't really put me down in everything. Struggling to work, wake up early and exercise.

I did what I could during that time. Not so much on strength training. Sometimes, I managed to pick myself up to do a quick 20 mins yoga. The other time, I meditated for 10 minutes. And yes, I stopped the package with Yoga Movement for the time being. Luckily, that time has passed.

### Second trimester

It was like magic. One day, I woke up and felt this surge of energy, a voice inside telling me I am myself again. I thought I could conquer some cardio exercise, yoga and meditation in 1 go. Indeed I did. I felt so glad and keep the momentum until today. Below are some of my favourite go-to videos.

* [Best Full Body Workout to Lose Fat 20 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGmr02bfHUo)

Of course, I don't plan to get ripped abs while my belly is getting bigger lol. These exercises simply help increase the heart rate and make me sweat moderately (at the rate that I'm comfortable with). I usually go for standing workouts so I don't have to modify a lot. Her normal workout includes quite a few of lying activities that I have to think how to modify. Also, the best thing about Chloe Ting videos is she includes low impact / no jumping options.

* A random video from her 30-day yoga journey

I follow Adriene's channel for few years so I have 100% belief and comfort in her style. I know I'll get stretched and mindful time. The main thing I look for is video length. At the minimum, I commit to 20 mins and on the day I wake up early, after a 15 mins cardio exercise, I sometimes choose a 40 mins video. Similar to Chloe Ting, if there are any lying poses, I would need to modify. But the pace here is much slower so I have some time to adapt accordingly.

#### Insight Time
For the past years of using Insight Timer, I added my favourite teachers to a list and I simply just choose a session I feel like doing that day. Some with music, some with guided instruction. I usually meditate for 15 - 20 mins. Then I'm off to start a new day.

### Third trimester

Third trimester hasn't come yet. And I read that there will be changes in hormone and energy level. Hence, that might affect my "perfect" plan. Let's see where life takes me.
